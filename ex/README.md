Example Programs
================

The programs in this directory are examples demonstrating how to use AMP. Each
example is a [MuseLang](../lang/README.md)+[AmpCore](../core/README.Md)
program that may be executed using [AmpRT](../rt/README.md). The programs are
first interpretted using an ML-like interpretter, constructing an execution
plan for processing audio data in real time. The following set of exammples
are provided:

  * [Distortion](#distortion) - Modular guitar distortion effect.

All examples are heavily documented with inline comments. Further explanation
is provided in this document.

## Distortion

The [distortion](dist.ml) example demonstrates a modular guitar distortion
effect, combining clipping, bitcrushing, tone control, and amplifier modeling.

## Licensing

All examples are provided under the MIT license, and may be used as the
foundation for larger programs.
